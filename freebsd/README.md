# Parasite
This is a work-in-progress project of rewritting the Parasite LKM for FreeBSD based devices (especially pfSense/routers). Due to the lack of resources and difficulties on working with TCP, it is currently using ICMP. 

## So what now?
More to come later, will keep updating this as I go :)
